TL;DR - 

Project:
	This script scrapes data off collegeswimming.com and puts it into a database. From
there I plan to build distributions for events, determine the relative effectiveness of 
tapers, and see if there is a statistically significant difference in taper quality
between schools with different speed suits. 

Files:
database.py
	a script to create the database of swims. The parameters are as follows
	databaseFileName: the output file name, in the directory this script is run
	eventsToPull: an array of events that will be searched for in each swimmer
	gendersToPull: an array of which genders to search for. any combination of "M" and "F"
	seasonsToPull: a date range to get team rosters from. Keep this small to prevent 
	               database errors from swimmers switching teams making duplicate swimmers
	seasonStartTimestamp: a timestamp used to check each swim if it's a part of our season
	                      it should match the beginning year of seasonsToPull
	teamsToPull: an array of teamIds that will be searched for. You can use the range
	             function, but this will 
	

Important Structures:
database structure
	each event will be in two tables, one for each gender
	the table name will be a gender char followed by collegeswimming.com's event structure
	for example: M1100Y - mens 100 yard freestyle; F5200Y - womens 200 yard IM
	the columns in the database are as follows (in order)
	-------------------------------------
	| name | date | time | team | taper |
	-------------------------------------
	name: a string of the name of the swimmer
	date: the day of the swim represented by the number of seconds since unix epoch
	time: a float representing the number of seconds the swim took
	team: an int for the team's teamId on collegeswimming.com
	taper: was this a taper swim? we have to guess. possible values:
		0 - we haven't determined whether or not this was a taper swim (the initial value)
		1 - this swim appears to be a taper swim (based off season times)
		2 - this swim appears to not be a taper swim (based off season times)

collegeswimming.com event structure
	the definition of events is as follows
	             ABBBBC
	with characters representing
	A: The stroke id number. An integer between 1 and 5
		1 - Freestyle
		2 - Backstroke
		3 - Breaststroke
		4 - Butterfly
		5 - Individual Meadly
	B: The distance of the event. While it shows there being 4 B's above, there is no
	   specification, it can be from 2 to 4 digits
	C: The pool type
		Y - short course yards
		L - long course meters
		S - I think short course meters, but I've never seen or tested this
	examples:
		150Y - 50 Yard Freestyle
		4100Y - 100 Yard Butterfly
		3200L - 200 Meter Breaststroke
	
collegeswimming.com url structure
	There are two urls we'll use from the website. The first is a list of the team roster.
	    http://www.collegeswimming.com/team/{A}/mod/teamroster?season={B}&gender={C}
	This url returns an HTML page, which must be scraped for swimmer names and ids.
	The curly braces "{}" are omitted and replaced with
	A: The team's id number. This is an index on the website. You can manually look this 
	   up by searching for a team and looking at the number in the url
	B: The range of years to get swimmers. In the format
	                    SSSS-EEEE
	   SSSS - the starting season year
	   EEEE - the ending season year
	   Using the selected dropdown spinner on the website, you're only allowed to do two
	   consecutive years (ex: 2014-2015), but strings are allowed to have unlimited range
	C: The gender of the roster. A 1 char representation.
		M - Men's team roster
		F - Women's team roster
	
	The second url we'll use is for a specific swimmer's event
	http://www.collegeswimming.com/swimmer/{A}/times/byeventid/{B}
	This url returns all the swims of the specified event json encoded.
	The curly braces "{}" are omitted and replaced with
	A: The swimmer's id number. This should be retreived from the team roster
	B: the event structure. This is defined above as "collegeswimming.com event structure"
